Maze generator

Info about your project goes here
Run the Maze.java to start generating a maze. Users are able to choose different algorithms by uncomment the generator they want.
After running the Maze.jave, the user can click "start game" button to play the maze. The user can use "up", "down", "left", "right" on the keybroad to control the ball's moving direction. The user can use "return" on the keybroad to stop the ball. 
When running the test, the test for Wilson's algorithm need to be run entirely, because the loopErasedRandomWalkReachesVisitedCell test will miss some necessary set up individually.
